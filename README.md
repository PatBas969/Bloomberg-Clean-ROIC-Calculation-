This is an Excel spreadsheet that calculates the Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) that follows the methodology of Valuation (the book). The spreadsheet outputs both historical ratios as well as forward-looking ones that are based on consensus numbers.  
The worksheet works for most stocks globally but works best but is most accurate for US and European stocks. Data comes from Bloomberg via an API. It is all coded in VBA. In cases where data was not available, the accounting items are estimated using historical relationships. 
Though the sheet seems unimpressive at first, it is actually difficult to find a dataset that does these kinds of calculations that are consistent, comparable and agnostic to company disclosures. 

To use it:

1. Paste tickers in the marked columns.
2. Press the button that pulls out the accounting data from Bloomberg
3. Generate a detailed sheet for each ticker one by one.
